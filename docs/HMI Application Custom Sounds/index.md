## HMI Application Custom Sounds

####Background
This topic was brought forward by a SmartDeviceLink Consortium (SDLC) Steering Committee representative via proposal [SDL 0103](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_evolution/blob/master/proposals/0103-ApplicationCustomSounds.md).  The proposed solution described within the proposal was accepted by the Steering Committee, as noted in the [review issue](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_evolution/issues/308).  This document serves to capture the best practice decided upon by the SDLC Steering Committee.

####Best Practice
**Application Partners shall control all in-vehicle noises.**

OEMs will not always know what is being projected to the head unit; this will make noise flags, noise triggers, and noise accuracy difficult to handle on the OEM side.  This makes Application Partner control advantageous.

####Additional Information
Additional information regarding the motivation for this best practice, alternatives considered, etc. can be found in the proposal [SDL 0103](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_evolution/blob/master/proposals/0103-ApplicationCustomSounds.md).
